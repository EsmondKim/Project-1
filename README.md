# Introversion

## User Story
AS AN introvert,<br>

I WANT a website to assist me with small talk by giving me current events and jokes,<br>

SO THAT I can feel more comfortable in daily conversations.<br>


Introversion is an app that helps introverts navigate awkward social environments. This app will generate jokes and news that will allow the user to engage in dreadful small talk.<br>
